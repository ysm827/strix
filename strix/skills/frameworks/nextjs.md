# Next.js

Security testing for Next.js applications. Focus on authorization drift across runtimes (Edge/Node), caching boundaries, server actions, and middleware bypass.

## Attack Surface

**Routers**
- App Router (`app/`) and Pages Router (`pages/`) often coexist
- Route Handlers (`app/api/**`) and API routes (`pages/api/**`)
- Middleware/proxy: inspect `middleware.ts`, `proxy.ts`, installed Next.js metadata, and runtime configuration. Check the matching framework docs for supported filenames, Node/Edge behavior, and feature status before selecting runtime-specific probes ([migration guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16)).

**Runtimes**
- Node.js (full API access)
- Edge (V8 isolates, restricted APIs)

**Rendering & Caching**
- SSR, SSG, ISR, on-demand revalidation
- RSC (React Server Components) with fetch cache
- Draft/preview mode

**Data Paths**
- Server Components, Client Components
- Server Actions (streamed POST with `Next-Action` header)
- `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`

**Integrations**
- NextAuth.js (callbacks, CSRF, callbackUrl)
- `next/image` optimization and remote loaders

## High-Value Targets

- Middleware-protected routes (auth, geo, A/B)
- Admin/staff paths, draft/preview content, on-demand revalidate endpoints
- RSC payloads and flight data, streamed responses
- Image optimizer and custom loaders, remotePatterns/domains
- NextAuth callbacks (`/api/auth/callback/*`), sign-in providers
- Edge-only features (bot protection, IP gates) and their Node equivalents

## Reconnaissance

At each assessment, establish the deployed build from package metadata, lockfiles, or runtime evidence. Verify release/support status and applicable fixes through current official docs, advisories, or upstream source; linked advisories are starting points, not a complete or permanently current list. Recheck when the target build or proposed remediation changes, and mark status unverified if evidence is unavailable.

**Route Discovery**

```javascript
// Browser console - list all routes
console.log(__BUILD_MANIFEST.sortedPages.join('\n'))

// Inspect server-fetched data
JSON.parse(document.getElementById('__NEXT_DATA__').textContent).props.pageProps

// List public environment variables
Object.keys(process.env).filter(k => k.startsWith('NEXT_PUBLIC_'))
```

**Build Artifacts**
```
GET /_next/static/<buildId>/_buildManifest.js
GET /_next/static/<buildId>/_ssgManifest.js
GET /_next/static/chunks/pages/
GET /_next/static/chunks/app/
```
Chunk filenames map to routes (e.g., `admin.js` → `/admin`).

**Source Maps**

Check `/_next/static/` for exposed `.map` files revealing route structure, server action IDs, and internal functions.

**Client Bundle Mining**

Search main-*.js for: `pathname:`, `href:`, `__next_route__`, `serverActions`, API endpoints. Grep for `API_KEY`, `SECRET`, `TOKEN`, `PASSWORD` to find accidentally leaked credentials.

**Server Action Discovery**

Inspect Network tab for POST requests with `Next-Action` header. Extract action IDs from response streams and hydration data.

**Additional Leakage**
- `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap-*.xml` for unintended admin/internal/preview paths
- Client bundles/env for secret paths and preview/admin flags (many teams hide routes via UI only)

## Key Vulnerabilities

### RSC and Image Processing

- **React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182):** App Router applications can expose the vulnerable RSC decoder without explicit Server Actions. Identify the bundled `react-server-dom-*` implementation and trace requests into decoding; client-only React and Pages-only apps have different exposure. Check the framework's patched branch, including source-disclosure and DoS fixes ([RCE advisory](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components), [RSC advisories](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/11/denial-of-service-and-source-code-exposure-in-react-server-components)).
- Treat `/_next/image` optimization and Node `next/og` `ImageResponse` as separate input paths. Trace attacker-controlled image bytes into native decoders, and SVG content/attributes/styles into image construction. URL allowlisting does not make image contents trusted; match the decoder, runtime, and Next.js version to the relevant advisory ([optimizer](https://nextjs.org/blog/august-2026-security-release), [ImageResponse](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-vcvr-r3jv-pc5j)).

### Middleware Bypass

**Known Techniques**
- `x-middleware-subrequest` header crafting (CVE-2025-29927): middleware-only authorization can be skipped on affected deployments. Resolve the installed branch and hosting protections from the advisory and provider configuration, then check whether external headers reach the origin and the destination enforces authorization independently ([advisory](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)).
- `x-nextjs-data` probing
- Look for 307 + `x-middleware-rewrite`/`x-nextjs-redirect` headers

**Path Normalization**
```
/api/users
/api/users/
/api//users
/api/./users
```
Middleware may normalize differently than route handlers. Test double slashes, trailing slashes, dot segments.

**Parameter Pollution**
```
?id=1&id=2
?filter[]=a&filter[]=b
```
Middleware checks first value, handler uses last or array.

### Server Actions

- Invoke actions outside UI flow with alternate content-types
- Authorization assumed from client state rather than enforced server-side
- IDOR via object references in action payloads
- Map action IDs from source maps to discover hidden actions

### RSC & Caching

**Cache Boundary Failures**
- User-bound data cached without identity keys (ETag/Set-Cookie unaware)
- Personalized content served from shared cache/CDN
- Missing `no-store` on sensitive fetches matters only when they enter a shared cache. Determine `fetch` and GET Route Handler defaults for the deployed version from docs/configuration and observed responses. Where Cache Components are enabled, inspect `use cache` arguments/closed-over values, `cacheTag`, `cacheLife`, and invalidation for user/tenant separation ([caching documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/cache-components)).

**Flight Data Leakage**

Inspect streamed RSC payloads for serialized sensitive fields in props.

**ISR Issues**
- Stale-while-revalidate responses containing user-specific or tenant-dependent data
- Weak secrets in on-demand revalidation endpoint URLs
- Referer-disclosed tokens or unvalidated hosts triggering `revalidatePath`/`revalidateTag`
- Header-smuggling or method variations to trigger revalidation

### Authentication

**NextAuth Pitfalls**
- Missing/relaxed state/nonce/PKCE per provider (login CSRF, token mix-up)
- Open redirect in `callbackUrl` or mis-scoped allowed hosts
- JWT audience/issuer not enforced across routes
- Cross-service token reuse
- Session hijacking by forcing callbacks

**Session Boundaries**
- Different auth enforcement between App Router and Pages Router
- API routes vs Route Handlers authorization inconsistency

### Data Exposure

**__NEXT_DATA__ Over-fetching**

Server-fetched data passed to client but not rendered:
- Full user objects when only username needed
- Internal IDs, tokens, admin-only fields
- ORM select-all patterns exposing entire records
- API responses forwarded without sanitization (metadata, cursors, debug info)

**Environment-Dependent Exposure**
- Staging/dev accidentally exposes more fields than production
- Inconsistent serialization logic across environments

**Props Inspection**
```javascript
// Check for sensitive data in page props
JSON.parse(document.getElementById('__NEXT_DATA__').textContent).props
```
Look for `_metadata`, `_internal`, `__typename` (GraphQL), nested sensitive objects.

### Image Optimizer SSRF

**Remote Patterns**
- Broad `images.domains`/`remotePatterns` in `next.config.js`
- Test: internal hosts, IPv4/IPv6 variants, DNS rebinding

**Custom Loaders**
- Protocol smuggling via redirect chains
- Cache poisoning via URL normalization differences affecting other users

### Runtime Divergence

**Edge vs Node**
- Defenses relying on Node-only modules skipped on Edge
- Header trust differs (`x-forwarded-*` handling)
- Same route may behave differently across runtimes

### Client-Side

**XSS Vectors**
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Markdown renderers
- User-controlled href/src attributes
- Validate CSP/Trusted Types coverage for SSR/CSR/hydration

**Hydration Mismatches**

Server vs client render differences can enable gadget-based XSS.

### Draft/Preview Mode

- Secret URLs/cookies enabling preview
- Preview secrets leaked in client bundles/env
- Setting preview cookies from subdomains or via open redirects

## Bypass Techniques

- Content-type switching: `application/json` ↔ `multipart/form-data` ↔ `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- Method override: `_method`, `X-HTTP-Method-Override`, GET on endpoints accepting writes
- Case/param aliasing and query duplication affecting middleware vs handler parsing
- Cache key confusion at CDN/proxy (lack of Vary on auth cookies/headers)

## Testing Methodology

1. **Enumerate** - Use `__BUILD_MANIFEST`, source maps, build artifacts, sitemap/robots to map all routes
2. **Runtime matrix** - Test each route under Edge and Node runtimes
3. **Role matrix** - Test as unauth/user/admin across SSR, API routes, Route Handlers, Server Actions
4. **Cache probing** - Verify caching respects identity (strip cookies, alter Vary headers, check ETags)
5. **Middleware validation** - Test path variants and header manipulation for bypass
6. **Cross-router** - Compare authorization between App Router and Pages Router paths

## Validation Requirements

- Side-by-side requests showing cross-user/tenant access
- Cache boundary failure proof (response diffs, ETag collisions)
- Server action invocation outside UI with insufficient auth
- Middleware bypass with explicit headers showing protected content access
- Runtime parity checks (Edge vs Node inconsistent enforcement)
- Discovered routes verified as deployed (200/403) not just build artifacts (404)
- Leaked credentials tested with minimal read-only calls; filter placeholders
- `__NEXT_DATA__` exposure: verify cross-user (User A's props shouldn't contain User B's PII), confirm exposed fields not in DOM
- Path normalization bypasses: show differential responses (403 vs 200), redirects don't count
